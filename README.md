In the paper, [*Connective field modeling*](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23110879), Koen Haak introduces a novel method to analyze cortico-cortical functional connectivity between retinotopic cortices. Here I show how to implement the code in [mrVista](http://white.stanford.edu/newlm/index.php/MrVista) and compute connective field (CF) models in Matlab.

hastalavistaCF is a short tutorial showing how to compute connective fields (Koen Haak, 2013) from fMRI time series in a transparent and straightforward way. Please feel free to modify, comment, extend and/or give feedback.
